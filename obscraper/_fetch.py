    The return value of `func` is placed in the `results` dict, under the dict key
    `label`. `obj_name` (optional) gives the type of the object (e.g. post) returned by
    `func` (this is used for logging only).

    If you want to pass arguments to `func`, use a `functools.partial` object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    results : dict
        A container to store the result of the function call.
    label : str
        A label (dict key) for the result.
    func : callable
        An async function whose return value should be added to the
        results.
    obj_type : str, optional
        The type of object returned by the function call. Used for
