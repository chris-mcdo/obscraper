obscraper: scrape posts from the overcomingbias blog
====================================================

``obscraper`` provides a basic API for posts on the `overcomingbias <https://www.overcomingbias.com/>`_ blog.

It's easy to get a single post:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import obscraper
    >>> intro_url = 'https://www.overcomingbias.com/2006/11/introduction.html'
    >>> intro = obscraper.get_post_by_url(intro_url)
    >>> intro.title
    'How To Join'
    >>> intro.plaintext
    'How can we better believe what is true? ...'
    >>> intro.internal_links
    {'http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/02/moderate_modera.html': 1, 
    'http://www.overcomingbias.com/2006/12/contributors_be.html': 1}
    >>> intro.comments
    20

And even easier to get all posts:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> all_posts = obscraper.get_all_posts()
    ...
    >>> len(all_posts)
    4353
    >>> [post.title for post in all_posts.values() if 'music' in post.tags]
    ['Silent Line-Videos Pick Music Winners', 'Classical Music As Tax',
    'Seek Superstar Slavery', 'Iâ€™ll Think of a Reason Later']
